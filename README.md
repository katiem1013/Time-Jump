## Time Jump! 

Time Jump is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle game, in which the player has to solve the disappearance of their partner with the use of time-travel. There are clues in both the present and past that will help solve the mystery, changing things in the past will help change things in the future. Leaving water to freeze in the past will produce ice in the future. However! The player's presence in the past is unwelcomed and the player will have to deal with the homeowner who is determined to get the player out of their house. The homeowner is a reactive AI that will do everything it can to stop the player. 

This game was a uni project for my Gaming Software class! Game Link: https://katiem1013.itch.io/time-jump

## The Process

This game was a university third year project. This project tasked me with creating a reactive AI that would hunt the player down. It needed to have the ability to react when the player would be too loud, or when the AI would catch sight of them to encourage the player to sneaky and intentional with all their moves. The player was also given the ability to change between present time and the past, while the house remained mostly the same there were hints of the past that would give answers to some of the puzzles and allow the player to get closer to the truth.
